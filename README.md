## Introduction

- Overview of the problem and possible solutions
Mossack Fonseca & Co. is a Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider, which is the world’s fourth biggest provider of offshore financial services. From its 1977 foundation until the April 2016 publication of the Panama Papers it remained mostly obscure, even though it sits at the heart of the global offshore industry, and acts for about 300,000 companies. More than half are registered in British tax havens – as well as in the UK. The firm received worldwide media attention in April 2016, when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published information about its clients' financial dealings in the Panama Papers articles, following the release of an enormous cache of its documents from between 1970 and 2015 leaked to the news media.
The solution to 
- Objective of the project.
Establishing a network among the person behind The Panama Paper Leak
Using graph databases becomes increasingly popular in domains where data can be modeled as a set of connected objects. Graph databases enable to query such data using graph-based queries in a relatively simple manner in comparison to the classical relational databases. In this project, we will use graph database, Neo4j, to identify the network behind the top-notch chain of interlinked people behind the biggest leak of history, The Panama Paper Case Leak.
Here, organizations would be considered as the node and the persons would be the relationship between the node. Further through machine learning algorithms we would study their relations and their effect on the society and produce our study output. As Machine learning is about analyzing data to ‘learn’ a model or using an algorithm that can be applied to make predictions on new data sets.  These insights can be expressed as relationships between nodes in a graph. Graph databases enable efficient storage and traversal of information about relationships. Therefore, graph data would be the input of machine learning processing. To yield our study to a valuable conclusion.
